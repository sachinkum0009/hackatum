### Hackatum

A GPT-RL app which helps students learn.

Motivation:

Each student learns differently, has different learning styles and needs. Therefore the teacher must cater their teaching strategy to suit the students needs.

Problem:

In traditional schooling, all students undergo the same curriculum, this one-size-fits-all style of education is not suitable for individual students.

Solution:

Goal oriented learning, each student should have clear goals,-> understanding the topic, and the app should teach the student to learn the material, by learning the behaviour of the student.

Methodology:

Reinforcement learning can help the student achieve this, by having the machine be rewarded for the student's success. And changing its strategy according to the likelihood of achieving the best outcome.

Goal based search:

Expert-Guided Learning:
The goal is simply to replicate the behaviour of the expert via observation and repeated observation. (Observation and learn)

Imitation Learning:
The learner is following an expert, yet the expert is not perfect, and may have different goals. (Action reaction)
